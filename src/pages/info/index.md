Inspired by indistinct and primal spaces, Marie d'Elbée explores the idea of animal-environment. 

An animal-environment is an animal that becomes an environment and an environment that becomes an animal. 

It behaves like a nourishing matrix crossbred from animal behaviours and collapsed stellar bodies. Tactile impressions of time-space become autonomous life forms, contracting and expanding like amorphous emotional fields.

Marie d'Elbée works with image, sound, object and installation. She explores ideas of undifferentiated states and universal connectedness, where boundaries between beings and environments dissolve, shifting fixed notions of self and matter
